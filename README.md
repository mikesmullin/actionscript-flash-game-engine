ActionScript 3 Flash 16 Game Engine
=========================

Ported from my [CoffeeScript+Node.JS Game Engine](https://github.com/mikesmullin/coffee-canvas-game-engine),
but designed to continue working with the Node.JS server back-end over websockets for multiplayer.

For maximum compatibility.

Demos:

* [Swinging Cubes](http://mikesmullin.github.io/actionscript-flash-game-engine/public/Main.swf)
